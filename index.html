      <p>I am a novice front-end developer programmer who previously worked in the aviation sector.
         Now I'm changing my profession and trying my hand at the Front-end field.
         I'm purposeful, assertive, achieve my goals and I'm a good team player.
         I have a high degree of responsibility and enthusiasm for a new business.
         I have basic concepts in programming and longing to gain new experience and knowledge and work on real
         projects.
